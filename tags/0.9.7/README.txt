README for PolyPager
-----------

installing
All you need to do to install is copy the files in 
some directory on a webserver and type in the URL to 
that directory... 
Then PolyPager will ask for a database and tell you what to do.

if you update from a previous version:

    * run the SQL in this file on your database: update_db.sql
    * you might not want to copy everything to your server, 
	because you'd overwrite certain things you already changed. 
	I recommend you don't overwrite PolyPager_Config.php and 
	most of the times you can also leave the user/ - directory as is.

wonder what features came in what version?
go to the bugs - page (http://polypager.nicolashoening.de/?bugs)
and search for bugs with the version you are looking for. Voila.
