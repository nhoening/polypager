README for PolyPager
-----------

installing
All you need to do to install is copy the files in 
some directory on a webserver and type in the URL to 
that directory... 
Then PolyPager will ask for a database and tell you what to do.

if you update from a previous version, run the SQL in this 
file on your database: 
http://polypager.googlecode.com/svn/branches/maintenance/upgrade_db.sql


wonder what features came in what version?
go to the bugs - page (http://polypager.nicolashoening.de/?bugs)
and search for bugs with the version you are looking for. Voila.
