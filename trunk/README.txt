INSTALLATION

All you need to do to install PolyPager is to copy all the files into 
some directory on your webserver. Then open a browser and type in the URL to 
that directory... 
Then PolyPager will ask for a database and tell you what to do.

if you update from a previous version, run the SQL in this 
file on your database:
