PolyPager is a Content Management System (CMS) for web pages. It gives you nice, simple websites. It is light-weight and preconfigured.

If all you want is a website, not just a blog, run by you and only you, with pages, comments, RSS-feeding, HTML templating as well as out-of-the-box HTML Editor and Image gallery - try PolyPager. It is easy to use. I know there are some real powerful and huge CMS systems out there, which give you a boat full of choices, but I guess some people don't want nor need to learn all these concepts. Featurewise, PolyPager is committed to not bloat anymore. I will work on improving what is there already.

PolyPager is better than any other CMS I know of in working with relational databases. If you are a developer and you want to be able to work on data from a relational database online, try PoLyPager Just tell it which table to use and how you would like to see it and it will integrate nicely with all the other pages on your site. PolyPager helps you to connect your data online by making use of your Foreign Keys.

A list of features:
--------------------

* simple setup (just uploading, specifying the database - done)
* WYSIWYG ("what you see is what you get") editing - the FCKEditor is built-in (and works right away, including image/file uploads)
* built-in picture gallery that also works right away (Qdig Gallery)
* file/folder administration for admins
* comments/guestbooks with spam blocking
* all administration is done online
* simple pages that you can create with one click
* pages that reflect data from any of your MySQL tables (called "complex pages") like a blog, a list of books you read etc... (some often-used complex pages are available as one-click templates - for example a blog, an FAQ etc ...)
* sophisticated search options
* RSS feeding
* generates a Sitemap according to the Google/Microsoft/Yahoo standard
* a CSS skin with several colorsets (it swaps header pictures randomly) - more are planned.
* HTML templating
* admins can edit their own CSS file online
* and all I forgot...
